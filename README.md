# AntiForbiks
VbScript which attempts to remove forbiks worm/virus and reverse the malicious actions by it.

There are 2 Variants -
  a. Normal Variant to run on any generic windows machine.
  b. AV Variant - To run along with AV like Symantec, Kaspersky, etc. (I have observed that in some cases, these AV softwares leave 0 bytes garbage which also requires clean-up and reversing - seperate version for that)

How to Use-
1. Run the VB Script file "AntiForbiks" on the affected system.
2. The script cleans all the drives including shared drives and USB, etc. So its better if you run the script with all the drives mapped.
